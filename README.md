<h1>Various Programs</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A small collection of Programs.  Some were written while progressing through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and IT Automation with Python Certificate.  Others are for fun.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python3</b>
- <b>Shell Script</b>
<!--
- <b>Java</b>

<h2>Python Programs:</h2>

[hello_world.py](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/hello_world.py)
- Everyone needs a Hello, World!

[areas.py](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/areas.py)
- Simple functions to calculate the area of a triangle, rectangle, circle, and donut.  Can be imported in Python and called individually.

[random-exit.py](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/random-exit.py)
- Returns a random integer for sys.exit

[count_digits.py](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/count_digits.py)
- This was a fun one.  This program solves an old math brain teaser/challenge from when I was in college.  The point is to count every digit you would pass when counting from 1 - 1,000,000.

<h2>Shell Script Programs:</h2>

[check_localhost.sh](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/check_localhost.sh)
- Uses grep command to check for the local host IP of 127.0.0.1.  Prints result to the screen.

[fruits.sh](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/fruits.sh)
- Uses a for loop to iterate through a small list.  Prints out the fruit from the list by passing a variable to the string.

[while.sh](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/while.sh)
- Simple while loop to iterate through a length of numbers.


[rename_test.sh](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/rename_test.sh)

[rename_test_back.sh](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/rename_test_back.sh)
- Both these functions rename files in the current directory.  The first renames all .py files to .test.  The second renames them back to .py.


<h2>Java Programs:</h2>

[HelloWorldApp.java](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/HelloWorldApp.java)
- Another one! Hello, World!

[CountDigits.java](https://github.com/mattycjr/programs/blob/main/CountDigits.java)
- Similar to the Python veresion above, but it is only set to 1,000,000.  However, there are two sets of code.  My version and the version of a friend of mine. Both get the job done, one is more efficient.
